Starfall is an upcoming science fiction massively multiplayer 4X game played in your browser. 4X as in eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate \u2013 games like Civilization, Master of Orion, or Stellaris focused on building an empire, gaining industry and technology, and subjugating rival empires through diplomacy or war. Everyone plays on the same map \u2013 no instancing or segregating users by server. Like most strategy games, you\u2019ll have all the tools you need to build an empire as a loner \u2013 but allies working together in Organizations can do truly incredible things on a massive scale. We expect to see player empires rise and fall, grow and recede from different star systems as time passes. Your units and progress persist when you\u2019re offline, so you can drop in and play whenever you please and drop out when life inevitably calls. Starfall is intended to be picked up and played when you have time and played from almost anywhere by virtue of being browser-based. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here. Let\u2019s start by talking about the four Xs. Explore The Map. Everything happens on the map. The galaxy has many star systems, and each star system is its own sprawling map filled with things to interact with. Heavenly bodies like stars, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets all exist on the map and can be interacted with, from mining asteroids to solar power from stars. Artificial objects exist too - other players' assets, obviously, but also non-player ships and bases, wrecks and salvage, and ancient ruins to investigate and reverse-engineer. We expect to see thousands of objects in star systems, and since all of them can be depleted, stolen, or blown up, each star system will change dramatically over time as players live in them. We're not fans of procedural generation and its endless piles of same-y stuff so we're working on ways to provide truly massive amounts of interesting, unique content. Discovery. We don't provide maps of all the stars out there - you have to go find and explore them yourselves with FTL-equipped starships. The next star system you explore could be an unhabited cornucopia of resources, or it could turn out to be a hive of the nastiest baddies imaginable. We want to reward explorers in a variety of ways, from letting them sell exclusive starmaps of their discovered systems to letting them name heavenly bodies. Detection. Unlike most strategy games, information isn't free. We won't just tell you that \"Drone X from Player Y appeared at coordinates (X,Y,Z).\" You need passive scanners to determine what's around you and active scanners to suss out how much of a threat they are. Transponders will let you broadcast your entity to others to build trust - but when an incoming ship has its transponder off, tension rises. Is it an ambushing enemy, or a damaged ally? Time's running out to make a decision, to shoot or not to shoot, before they get too close... The Narrative. Every system is packed with the good, the bad, and the ugly from the minute the first player jumps in. We don't believe in static quest lines - everyone deserves a unqiue experience. Because of this, quest-givers and narrative factions live on the same map and use the same systems as players. If players band together to wipe out an NPC faction, they're dead. We want to respond to cues the players give us as far as what they want to see more of instead of interrupting their gameplay with a plotline. The narrative is also a way we can keep star systems from becoming totally settled, static, and boring - perhaps the enemies that the players drove out of Star A migrated their way to Star B to clash with the locals, or perhaps they call in reinforcements from parsecs away to try and retake Star A months down the road. Calling BS! Everybody knows that procedural generation makes an identical ocean of crap, but without it content creation is glacial. How are you going to get enough content to meaningfully fill hundreds of star systems? All true. We're working on ways to mitigate it which will probably be a later blog post. We may need to lean on a dash of procgen to keep opening up fully fleshed systems as there's need, but not going full procedural generation. That does lead to worlds as wide as an ocean and deep as a puddle. Ideally we'd have both - but we'll choose depth over width every time. We plan to reward both early explorers and latecomers to star systems with a variety of resources, NPCs, and missions. Expand Exhaustable Map Objects. - As we said above, just about anything on the game map can be mined, stolen, or at the very least blown up. Thousands of heavenly bodies and artificial objects in each star system will encourage players to expand and prevent long-term turtling. You can't just sit on a resource deposit forever - it will run out eventually! We even track colossal objects like gas giants and stars in this way, so (with a gargantuan amount of effort and technologies) they too could be depleted. Politics and Small Gangs\u2122. - You can be a loner and build and tech up on your own if you want to, but friends let you hold a larger area against massive Organizations. A variety of ingame Org tools let you keep your line members in the core gameplay loop without spreadsheeting your org structure and responsibilities. We want to encourage and reward the \"small gang\" concept - a small group of friends who know each other well playing Starfall together, each with their own speciality. It's our vision that while gigantic and more monolithic Organizations will fight over many star systems, a small gang of dedicated friends can at least reliably hold a planetary system on their own. Like most browser strategy games, a single player can do everything - but having friends means you can specialize. Exploit Industry. - We've built a fully in-universe supply chain from start to finish - that shell you shot from your railgun was mined from an asteroid, refined into metals, stamped into ammunition, and loaded into your ship by real factories all in the game world. Supply chains of varying levels make industry deep enough to be a rewarding full time gig for builders and traders, while not becoming frustrating for other player types. We hope to let you get as deep into industry as you want (or don't want). If crafting isn't your thing, a huge variety of player and NPC traders (NPCs who also gather materials from the game world like you do, remember) can sell you whatever you need. Tech. - A 4X game is nothing without the almighty tech tree. Technologies are tradeable and giftable, covering improvements both incremental and revolutionary. To avoid new players being at an insurmountable disadvantage, we'll gradually increase the tech level of new players over time to give them a more level playing field. Blueprints. - Like most space 4Xes, you'll eventually be able to design and build your own drones from hundreds of components. This is our favorite part of games like Stellaris and Space Empires, and a good space 4X really isn't complete without it. We may not have this available at launch, but in the short term there will still be hundreds of drone blueprints to choose from. Designs. - but unlike most space 4Xes, we'll also eventually give you the ability to create your own components! Want to optimize a railgun to be gigantic at the cost of all else? Or create your own brand of ship components you get credit and profit from as they corner the market? Or have your Organization run off of a completely custom supply chain with designs you design, build, and hold the exclusive rights to? You'll be able to do it - just probably not right at release. Calling BS! Custom designs and blueprints - how do I know this isn't marketing garbage? Easy! The code already works this way, we just haven't enabled it. There's a ton of balance and UI work that has to go into allowing these things fairly, so the more you help out the faster it'll arrive. Having research happen even when your're offline is both good balance and part of our plan for ethical gameplay. Take breaks, kids! Exterminate War. - Good old shells, lasers, and missiles with a variety of defenses to balance them makes pursuing a PVP meta rewarding and enables varied fleet compositions for huge fights. All drones persist on the same map 24/7, so you can come to your ally's aid or ambush prey with equal ease. We don't specify \"battles\" or \"wars\" in the game's code - anyone in the area can drop into a fight at any time, and there's no predetermined end to a battle - either one side is destroyed, or retreats, or the players declare a ceasefire. Market. - Business is just a different kind of war. You'll be able to create and execute contracts to buy, sell, and share tech, resources, starmaps, and drones. We want to reward explorers for finding new star systems, industrialists for perfecting their supply chain, and designers for perfectly tweaking their blueprints. The market is the way to go. More Politics. - War is the most obvious interaction between Organizations, but it's so much more than lining up and shooting one another. Contracts and custom designs let Orgs wage economic war on one another. Players can belong to multiple Orgs, which when coupled with our detection and line of sight systems means that emergent gameplay like ambushes, false flag attacks, rules of engagement, plausible deniability, and collateral damage become a reality. Whether you lead a battlegroup or a mining gang, there'll be plenty of opportunity to harvest salt. It's free Yeah I know, free-to-play is garbage. But we're not really in it for the money. We've got jobs and incomes already, and a passion to make the game of our dreams. We've planned to ensure costs stay low and can come out of our pockets to a certain point. We have some thoughts on ethical monetization to pay for eventual server costs which we'll share soon (because quitting our jobs to make Starfall would be great eventually), but we're not asking for your money. We're just asking you to come and play. It's in the browser What is this, 2007? What are you, Jennifer Government: NationStates ? Wha- alright, we're starting in the browser because it's ridiculously extensible - you can play on desktop or on your phone, we can wrap it as a mobile app, Windows app, Steam game, console game, expose APIs for savvy players - we could probably make it work on your smartwatch. We got our start in browser strategy games and modern .NET and web technologies let you do some crazy stuff nowadays. We even had a browser 3D client test. We can expand into many many directions, the point is that we nail the architecture first so we can deliver cool stuff for years without being gut punched by legacy code. We'll talk more about each of these pieces as we get closer to public alpha testing later in this accursed year of 2020.

Click Next below for more!","title":"It's in the browser"},{"location":"whatis/map/","text":"The Map and Exploration Let's dive a little deeper into the game we're building, one chunk at a time. Today we're talking about the map and how you explore it. The Map Everything happens on the map. Once upon a time, browser strategy games were little more than webforms where you'd click between pages of tables of data, click a few buttons, and get an image for flavor if you were lucky. This may have been acceptable in the days of DSL internet, but it's pretty boring in the futuristic year of 2020. Almost all of our favorite strategy games revolve around the map, where you can see your empire rise and (hopefully not) fall in a way that really viscerally appeals to our primate brains. Starting with an expansive map was the obvious choice for Starfall. Structuring the map well and filling it with good content is so important because we want to encourage player mobility. We want players to be able to migrate to places and things they find fun over time, rather than being stuck wherever they built their headquarters. Players will be able to put engines on any of their designs - this is one reason why player assets are drones and not ships or stations. The other reason is that players are starfaring AIs, but more on that later. We have an entire galaxy to get through, so let's start from the top down. The Galaxy Star systems are our basic navigational unit - there are many of them in the galaxy, and everything interesting on the map (planets, moons, your drones, everyone else's drones) resides in specific star systems. Think of them like islands. You'll jump to new star systems using the faster-than-light (FTL) jump drives on your drones, and then once you're there you'll discover the celestial bodies and hostile natives within. Discovery You'll discover new star systems or buy starcharts from other players to expand your list of destinations. One of our central game design tenants is \"information isn't free.\" We won't provide you a map of all the stars in the galaxy - you'll have to go find and explore them yourselves. Right now we envision that happening in two ways: Detection. Much like the pros , you can equip exosolar detection gear on your own drones and go searching for new stars. For each one you detect you'll receive a starmap - all the data your drones need to safely FTL jump to that system. You can jump to the first one you see or stay in one place to build your own star catalog. Commerce. On the other hand, if someone else already has starmaps you want, you can just use the ingame market to buy them. This is the more literal interpretation of \"information isn't free.\" If you fancy yourself an astronomer, you can try jumping to the frontier of settled space and detecting a bunch of new stars in order to sell the starmaps to other players - they'll likely pay a higher price for stars nobody has explored yet. Star Systems Each star system is a gigantic, bustling destination unto itself - even our test star system is already getting pretty busy. We hope to give players a good sense of how big a star system actually is. We can populate systems with a truly epic amount of celestial objects, from inner rocky planets to gas giants with their dozens of moons, from inner asteroid belts to Oort objects and comets near the heliopause. All of them will be interactable in some way, most of them mineable. You can set up shop anywhere in a solar system, whether jockeying for control of a Jovian planetary system or disappearing into the Oort Cloud to mine, refine, and resupply. Like in the real world, most asteroids are separated by significant distance, so you can set up a defensive perimeter around one and mine it to fuel your supply chain until it's depleted or you want to move on. We also don't plan to cap the number of players that can be present in one solar system. If there's a big showdown between Organizations, we want everyone to be able to dogpile in. For that matter, there's no restrictions on having a player's drones across multiple star systems. Finally, some star systems will have natives to contend with. That could mean non-player drones, bases, or other species entirely. You may also run across wrecks, salvage, or ancient ruins to investigate and reverse-engineer. These will present varying levels of challenge to players. Some may be pushovers a sole explorer can handle, while you may find some so strong that a concerted effort will be required to defeat them. The Action You'll issue orders to your drones directly from the game map. All gameplay happens from the map. Everything you physically own exists on the same map as all other players and NPCs in that star system. We don't plan on instancing or splitting the playerbase by server - it's just not fun. You'll issue orders to your drones from the map, whether they'll be moving or shooting or mining or fabricating parts for construction. You'll see the results of those orders on the map on the following tick (unit of game time). Every game, even \"real time\" ones, measure game time in ticks - some are milliseconds long as in shooters, while ours will likely be on the order of minutes. Right now, that's a necessary tradeoff to have one game world with no separating players or systems getting out of sync. For now we'll accept a longer tick duration and work to make the gameplay loop engaging regardless of session length. Later, we have some research to do about parallelization and infrastructure to get the best performance. That's all for the map. Next time we'll be talking about the first step in interacting with this game world - detecting player drones and stellar objects.","title":"The Map and Exploration"},{"location":"whatis/map/#the-map-and-exploration","text":"Let's dive a little deeper into the game we're building, one chunk at a time.

We also don't plan to cap the number of players that can be present in one solar system. If there's a big showdown between Organizations, we want everyone to be able to dogpile in. For that matter, there's no restrictions on having a player's drones across multiple star systems. Finally, some star systems will have natives to contend with. That could mean non-player drones, bases, or other species entirely. You may also run across wrecks, salvage, or ancient ruins to investigate and reverse-engineer. These will present varying levels of challenge to players. Some may be pushovers a sole explorer can handle, while you may find some so strong that a concerted effort will be required to defeat them.","title":"Star Systems"},{"location":"whatis/map/#the-action","text":"You'll issue orders to your drones directly from the game map. All gameplay happens from the map. Everything you physically own exists on the same map as all other players and NPCs in that star system. We don't plan on instancing or splitting the playerbase by server - it's just not fun. You'll issue orders to your drones from the map, whether they'll be moving or shooting or mining or fabricating parts for construction. You'll see the results of those orders on the map on the following tick (unit of game time). Every game, even \"real time\" ones, measure game time in ticks - some are milliseconds long as in shooters, while ours will likely be on the order of minutes. Right now, that's a necessary tradeoff to have one game world with no separating players or systems getting out of sync. For now we'll accept a longer tick duration and work to make the gameplay loop engaging regardless of session length. Later, we have some research to do about parallelization and infrastructure to get the best performance. That's all for the map. Next time we'll be talking about the first step in interacting with this game world - detecting player drones and stellar objects.","title":"The Action"}]}
