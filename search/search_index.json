One day!","title":"Change log"},{"location":"whatis/","text":"Posted 11/25/20 by AI Wizard What is Starfall? Ancient placeholder art and UI aside, we have a functional game! Starfall is an upcoming science fiction massively multiplayer 4X game played in your browser. 4X as in eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate \u2013 games like Civilization, Master of Orion, or Stellaris focused on building an empire, gaining industry and technology, and subjugating rival empires through diplomacy or war. Everyone plays on the same map \u2013 no instancing or segregating users by server. Like most strategy games, you\u2019ll have all the tools you need to build an empire as a loner \u2013 but allies working together in Organizations can do truly incredible things on a massive scale. We expect to see player empires rise and fall, grow and recede from different star systems as time passes. Your units and progress persist when you\u2019re offline, so you can drop in and play whenever you please and drop out when life inevitably calls. Starfall is intended to be picked up and played when you have time and played from almost anywhere by virtue of being browser-based. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here. Let\u2019s start by talking about the four Xs. Explore The Map. Everything happens on the map. The galaxy has many star systems, and each star system is its own sprawling map filled with things to interact with. Heavenly bodies like stars, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets all exist on the map and can be interacted with, from mining asteroids to solar power from stars. Artificial objects exist too - other players' assets, obviously, but also non-player ships and bases, wrecks and salvage, and ancient ruins to investigate and reverse-engineer. We expect to see thousands of objects in star systems, and since all of them can be depleted, stolen, or blown up, each star system will change dramatically over time as players live in them. We're not fans of procedural generation and its endless piles of same-y stuff so we're working on ways to provide truly massive amounts of interesting, unique content. Discovery. We don't provide maps of all the stars out there - you have to go find and explore them yourselves with FTL-equipped starships. The next star system you explore could be an unhabited cornucopia of resources, or it could turn out to be a hive of the nastiest baddies imaginable. We want to reward explorers in a variety of ways, from letting them sell exclusive starmaps of their discovered systems to letting them name heavenly bodies. Detection. Unlike most strategy games, information isn't free. We won't just tell you that \"Drone X from Player Y appeared at coordinates (X,Y,Z).\" You need passive scanners to determine what's around you and active scanners to suss out how much of a threat they are. Transponders will let you broadcast your entity to others to build trust - but when an incoming ship has its transponder off, tension rises. Is it an ambushing enemy, or a damaged ally? Time's running out to make a decision, to shoot or not to shoot, before they get too close... The Narrative. Every system is packed with the good, the bad, and the ugly from the minute the first player jumps in. We don't believe in static quest lines - everyone deserves a unqiue experience. Because of this, quest-givers and narrative factions live on the same map and use the same systems as players. If players band together to wipe out an NPC faction, they're dead. We want to respond to cues the players give us as far as what they want to see more of instead of interrupting their gameplay with a plotline. The narrative is also a way we can keep star systems from becoming totally settled, static, and boring - perhaps the enemies that the players drove out of Star A migrated their way to Star B to clash with the locals, or perhaps they call in reinforcements from parsecs away to try and retake Star A months down the road. Calling BS! Everybody knows that procedural generation makes an identical ocean of crap, but without it content creation is glacial. How are you going to get enough content to meaningfully fill hundreds of star systems? All true. We're working on ways to mitigate it which will probably be a later blog post. We may need to lean on a dash of procgen to keep opening up fully fleshed systems as there's need, but not going full procedural generation. That does lead to worlds as wide as an ocean and deep as a puddle. Ideally we'd have both - but we'll choose depth over width every time. We plan to reward both early explorers and latecomers to star systems with a variety of resources, NPCs, and missions. Expand Exhaustable Map Objects. - As we said above, just about anything on the game map can be mined, stolen, or at the very least blown up. Thousands of heavenly bodies and artificial objects in each star system will encourage players to expand and prevent long-term turtling. You can't just sit on a resource deposit forever - it will run out eventually! We even track colossal objects like gas giants and stars in this way, so (with a gargantuan amount of effort and technologies) they too could be depleted. Politics and Small Gangs\u2122. - You can be a loner and build and tech up on your own if you want to, but friends let you hold a larger area against massive Organizations. A variety of ingame Org tools let you keep your line members in the core gameplay loop without spreadsheeting your org structure and responsibilities. We want to encourage and reward the \"small gang\" concept - a small group of friends who know each other well playing Starfall together, each with their own speciality. It's our vision that while gigantic and more monolithic Organizations will fight over many star systems, a small gang of dedicated friends can at least reliably hold a planetary system on their own. Like most browser strategy games, a single player can do everything - but having friends means you can specialize. Exploit Industry. - We've built a fully in-universe supply chain from start to finish - that shell you shot from your railgun was mined from an asteroid, refined into metals, stamped into ammunition, and loaded into your ship by real factories all in the game world. Supply chains of varying levels make industry deep enough to be a rewarding full time gig for builders and traders, while not becoming frustrating for other player types. We hope to let you get as deep into industry as you want (or don't want). If crafting isn't your thing, a huge variety of player and NPC traders (NPCs who also gather materials from the game world like you do, remember) can sell you whatever you need. Tech. - A 4X game is nothing without the almighty tech tree. Technologies are tradeable and giftable, covering improvements both incremental and revolutionary. To avoid new players being at an insurmountable disadvantage, we'll gradually increase the tech level of new players over time to give them a more level playing field. Blueprints. - Like most space 4Xes, you'll eventually be able to design and build your own drones from hundreds of components. This is our favorite part of games like Stellaris and Space Empires, and a good space 4X really isn't complete without it. We may not have this available at launch, but in the short term there will still be hundreds of drone blueprints to choose from. Designs. - but unlike most space 4Xes, we'll also eventually give you the ability to create your own components! Want to optimize a railgun to be gigantic at the cost of all else? Or create your own brand of ship components you get credit and profit from as they corner the market? Or have your Organization run off of a completely custom supply chain with designs you design, build, and hold the exclusive rights to? You'll be able to do it - just probably not right at release. Calling BS! Custom designs and blueprints - how do I know this isn't marketing garbage? Easy! The code already works this way, we just haven't enabled it. There's a ton of balance and UI work that has to go into allowing these things fairly, so the more you help out the faster it'll arrive. Having research happen even when your're offline is both good balance and part of our plan for ethical gameplay. Take breaks, kids! Exterminate War. - Good old shells, lasers, and missiles with a variety of defenses to balance them makes pursuing a PVP meta rewarding and enables varied fleet compositions for huge fights. All drones persist on the same map 24/7, so you can come to your ally's aid or ambush prey with equal ease. We don't specify \"battles\" or \"wars\" in the game's code - anyone in the area can drop into a fight at any time, and there's no predetermined end to a battle - either one side is destroyed, or retreats, or the players declare a ceasefire. Market. - Business is just a different kind of war. You'll be able to create and execute contracts to buy, sell, and share tech, resources, starmaps, and drones. We want to reward explorers for finding new star systems, industrialists for perfecting their supply chain, and designers for perfectly tweaking their blueprints. The market is the way to go. More Politics. - War is the most obvious interaction between Organizations, but it's so much more than lining up and shooting one another. Contracts and custom designs let Orgs wage economic war on one another. Players can belong to multiple Orgs, which when coupled with our detection and line of sight systems means that emergent gameplay like ambushes, false flag attacks, rules of engagement, plausible deniability, and collateral damage become a reality. Whether you lead a battlegroup or a mining gang, there'll be plenty of opportunity to harvest salt. It's free Yeah I know, free-to-play is garbage. But we're not really in it for the money. We've got jobs and incomes already, and a passion to make the game of our dreams. We've planned to ensure costs stay low and can come out of our pockets to a certain point. We have some thoughts on ethical monetization to pay for eventual server costs which we'll share soon (because quitting our jobs to make Starfall would be great eventually), but we're not asking for your money. We're just asking you to come and play. It's in the browser What is this, 2007? What are you, Jennifer Government: NationStates ? Wha- alright, we're starting in the browser because it's ridiculously extensible - you can play on desktop or on your phone, we can wrap it as a mobile app, Windows app, Steam game, console game, expose APIs for savvy players - we could probably make it work on your smartwatch. We got our start in browser strategy games and modern .NET and web technologies let you do some crazy stuff nowadays. We even had a browser 3D client test. We can expand into many many directions, the point is that we nail the architecture first so we can deliver cool stuff for years without being gut punched by legacy code. We'll talk more about each of these pieces as we get closer to public alpha testing later in this accursed year of 2020.

Here's how we're getting from where we are now to a playable version of Starfall. Release Philosophy Most games have an Alpha, then a public Beta, then they launch. This works well for large studios, but with smaller operations like us players feel shafted when a game is stuck in public beta for months and months - or worse, when an unfinished game is rushed to production to avoid the beta stigma. To avoid this, we're taking the exact opposite approach. We don't know precisely when we'll launch, so we aren't going to declare a public alpha or beta. Instead, we're starting from omega. Each subsequent release will be opened to a slightly wider audience of testers and players and receive more and more polish as time goes on. When we're ready to call Starfall ready for prime time, you'll know. With that in mind, let's talk about our first \"release\" - Omega. Omega Release (\u03a9) OMEGA (\u03a9) is our first release and will not be open to any players. This is because has absolutely no polish (for example, there's no attack button - you have to input attacker ID, weapon ID, and target ID into a form) so it's not at all enjoyable to play and difficult to test. Omega is on this list because it marks feature completion internally for us as a milestone and sets us on the road to launch. We hope to have Omega complete by December 28th. Psi Release (\u03c8) PSI (\u03c8) is the next release and first playable release. It will include the user interface and quality of life work you need to actually be able to play it. Psi will be open to folks on the Arke Industries Discord server for the purposes of testing. Major pieces of work to get Psi out the door will be UI work, major refactoring for performance, and filling out the tech tree, recipes, components and industrial processes to give you content to play with. We're targeting release of \u03c8 sometime in January and will give you more updates as we get closer. We are on track to offer the following in Psi: Galaxy and Star System Maps filled with interactable objects like asteroids Drones that can detect, move, shoot, mine, transfer cargo, and do industrial processes like mining, refining, manufacturing, and assembling more drones Detection system taking into account everything in the Detection post on this blog Combat system taking into account weapon type and active and passive defenses Simple drone designing (create a blueprint by specifying a Hull and Components) Player Organizations and Squads that can be created and joined Market offers that can be offered and accepted to trade drones or cargos for other drones, cargos, or currency Research system unlocking technology groups, tracks, and elements both for incremental improvements of components and brand new components Later releases As you may have guessed, we're going to continue going backwards through the Greek alphabet with our releases until we have a candidate that is suitable for formal game launch.

Today we're talking about detection and display on the map. As we've said, \"Information isn't free\" is one of our design philosophies. Unlike most strategy games, detection isn't all-or-nothing. We've taken inspiration from real target acquisition in modern combat, where commanders have to quickly decide with limited information whether an incoming target is an enemy bomber or an off-course jetliner. You'll have to strike a balance with limited information - shoot first and potentially hit a third party, or wait for confirmation and risk being struck hard. In increasing difficulty order, we want to show you multiple things about a given contact to help you decide what to do about it: Location . Where was the contact detected? What is its bearing? Emissivity . How much heat and EM is it giving off? Hot, \"noisy\" contacts can indicate a higher threat. Design . What components are on this drone? Is it a freighter or a gunship? Identity . Which player owns this drone? Are they a known enemy? On top of showing you varying levels of sensor data, we'll also show you other information to understand a threat situation at a glance - info about your fellow Organization and Squad members, designations you set for other players, and who's recently been in combat. Scanning You can equip your drones with Scanners to gather this information. Similarly, you can equip your drones with Jammers to make it harder for an opponent to gather certain pieces of information. Whether a scan attempt succeeds depends on how strong the Scanner is, how strong an opposing Jammer is, and the distance between the two. Your drones' scanners scan every game tick. Because objects are often moving and there is an element of randomness to the calculations, your scanners may sometimes succeed and sometimes fail to resolve contacts, especially at range. Here is an extreme example of scan results varying over time, caused by setting scanner efficiencies very low. Here are the biggest factors that impact how easily your drones can be detected: Distance . In keeping with the inverse-square law , it's increasingly hard to detect electromagnetic radiation as distance increases. Heat . The hotter you run (doing things like like using your engines, firing weapons, or heavy industry) the easier you are to detect against the cold background of space. Electromagnetic radiation . We simply call it \"EM,\" a catch-all for light, radar, radio sources that your drone may be putting off or reflecting. Much like stealth planes in real life, drones can be designed to reduce this output. Size . Go figure, big stuff is easier to detect. This is most obvious for celestial bodies. Transponders . You can broadcast your location and identity if a drone has a transponder onboard - not very useful for war, but critical for building trust for trade and cooperation. Jammers . Different types of jammers obfuscate some of these factors - heat sinks can reduce heat signatures temporarily, ECM can make EM harder to pinpoint - but none can totally hide you. As the man says, There Ain't No Stealth In Space - but you can misdirect and obfuscate enough to exploit your opponent's hesitation. Contacts Here, three of our drones detect an unknown Contact to the right. When you first detect other players' drones and other game objects, they'll appear as Contacts. These are sensor objects which merely tells you that something exists out there. These sensor objects appear on the map and give you some or all of this information when clicked: Location. Size. Bearing . Is it headed towards you, away from you, somewhere else? Contacts on an intercept course are much more suspicious. Emissivity . How much heat and EM is it giving off? External components. What can we detect on the outside of the drone? These will be things like engines and external weapons. Internal components. What can we detect on the inside of the drone? This is much harder and can require specialized equipment like penetrating radar. Designations Here we see Enemy-marked contacts in red, Friends in blue, Suspicious in purple, and Targets in orange. Because the combat picture can be nuanced, we want to give you a way to note to yourself players of interest. These designations will show on all contacts that you know they control. We're starting with these: Friend. Regardless of Org or combat status, you consider this player friendly. All their drones will be marked as such. Enemy. Again regardless of Org or combat status, you consider this player an enemy and want all of their drones to be marked as such. This can be useful to identify enemy reinforcements early. Suspicious. If someone's snooping around or following you, mark their drones as Suspicious to keep an eye on what they're doing. Target. This can be for anything you want - maybe you want to target a neutral player in order to protect them (perhaps as part of a contract), or there's some non-combat reason why you want them on your proverbial radar. We'll likely add other types of Designations as users suggest them. Affiliations On top of your own records about other players and their drones, you may also be in one or more Organizations of players. You may also be placed in a single Squad in your Org (more on that later). In the heat of battle, you'll need a way to easily tell who around you is in your Squad, who is merely in your Org, and who is not related to you at all. Combat Status Thick dashed red lines mean that a contact was attacked recently. You can see it on our drone and the neutral contact in the top left. There's one more type of info that you'll need to know in the moment - combat action information. More specifically, you'll need to know: About other drones: Which drones attacked you recently Which drones are owned by the same player as ones who attacked you recently (and so are likely threats) Which drones did you attack recently Which drones are owned by the same player as ones you attacked recently (and so may counterattack) About your drones: Which of your drones attacked recently Which of your drones were attacked recently Our current MVP of this combat information system uses boxes because they're easy to render, but we'll probably boil these down into icon sets that we can user test. These icons have to be immediately recognizable and understandable on a busy battlefield. History Because we have a chunk of time between ticks (to allow us to process actions and events together), we're not quite real time. That means it's important that we give you tools to understand what's changed since you last logged on. History will show you what happened around your ships recently, up to the limit of their scanners. It replays as if you were there to witness it, but it's just a historical record. It's best seen to be explained. Here's a video of a user browsing the history of their drones' sensor data for the past few game ticks: Keep in mind that the UI is very much a placeholder for testing. Before going live we'll want to give you something more like media player controls - stop, start, rewind, fast forward. We're still testing to see how much history we can offer players on our current level of hosting since it's very CPU and memory hungry. We want to try and keep monetization limited to things that represent big hosting or processing costs for us, so having a very long history replay may be something that costs money. More on ethical monetization later. That's all for detection and display.

Today we're talking about detection and display on the map. As we've said, \"Information isn't free\" is one of our design philosophies. Unlike most strategy games, detection isn't all-or-nothing. We've taken inspiration from real target acquisition in modern combat, where commanders have to quickly decide with limited information whether an incoming target is an enemy bomber or an off-course jetliner. You'll have to strike a balance with limited information - shoot first and potentially hit a third party, or wait for confirmation and risk being struck hard. In increasing difficulty order, we want to show you multiple things about a given contact to help you decide what to do about it: Location . Where was the contact detected? What is its bearing? Emissivity . How much heat and EM is it giving off? Hot, \"noisy\" contacts can indicate a higher threat. Design . What components are on this drone? Is it a freighter or a gunship? Identity . Which player owns this drone? Are they a known enemy? On top of showing you varying levels of sensor data, we'll also show you other information to understand a threat situation at a glance - info about your fellow Organization and Squad members, designations you set for other players, and who's recently been in combat.","title":"Detection and Display"},{"location":"whatis/detect/#scanning","text":"You can equip your drones with Scanners to gather this information. Similarly, you can equip your drones with Jammers to make it harder for an opponent to gather certain pieces of information. Whether a scan attempt succeeds depends on how strong the Scanner is, how strong an opposing Jammer is, and the distance between the two. Your drones' scanners scan every game tick. Because objects are often moving and there is an element of randomness to the calculations, your scanners may sometimes succeed and sometimes fail to resolve contacts, especially at range. Here is an extreme example of scan results varying over time, caused by setting scanner efficiencies very low. Here are the biggest factors that impact how easily your drones can be detected: Distance . In keeping with the inverse-square law , it's increasingly hard to detect electromagnetic radiation as distance increases. Heat . The hotter you run (doing things like like using your engines, firing weapons, or heavy industry) the easier you are to detect against the cold background of space. Electromagnetic radiation . We simply call it \"EM,\" a catch-all for light, radar, radio sources that your drone may be putting off or reflecting.

Today we're talking about the map and how you explore it. The Map Everything happens on the map. Once upon a time, browser strategy games were little more than webforms where you'd click between pages of tables of data, click a few buttons, and get an image for flavor if you were lucky. This may have been acceptable in the days of DSL internet, but it's pretty boring in the futuristic year of 2020. Almost all of our favorite strategy games revolve around the map, where you can see your empire rise and (hopefully not) fall in a way that really viscerally appeals to our primate brains. Starting with an expansive map was the obvious choice for Starfall. Structuring the map well and filling it with good content is so important because we want to encourage player mobility. We want players to be able to migrate to places and things they find fun over time, rather than being stuck wherever they built their headquarters. Players will be able to put engines on any of their designs - this is one reason why player assets are drones and not ships or stations. The other reason is that players are starfaring AIs, but more on that later. We have an entire galaxy to get through, so let's start from the top down. The Galaxy Star systems are our basic navigational unit - there are many of them in the galaxy, and everything interesting on the map (planets, moons, your drones, everyone else's drones) resides in specific star systems. Think of them like islands. You'll jump to new star systems using the faster-than-light (FTL) jump drives on your drones, and then once you're there you'll discover the celestial bodies and hostile natives within. Discovery You'll discover new star systems or buy starcharts from other players to expand your list of destinations. One of our central game design tenants is \"information isn't free.\" We won't provide you a map of all the stars in the galaxy - you'll have to go find and explore them yourselves. Right now we envision that happening in two ways: Detection. Much like the pros , you can equip exosolar detection gear on your own drones and go searching for new stars. For each one you detect you'll receive a starmap - all the data your drones need to safely FTL jump to that system. You can jump to the first one you see or stay in one place to build your own star catalog. Commerce. On the other hand, if someone else already has starmaps you want, you can just use the ingame market to buy them. This is the more literal interpretation of \"information isn't free.\" If you fancy yourself an astronomer, you can try jumping to the frontier of settled space and detecting a bunch of new stars in order to sell the starmaps to other players - they'll likely pay a higher price for stars nobody has explored yet. Star Systems Each star system is a gigantic, bustling destination unto itself - even our test star system is already getting pretty busy. We hope to give players a good sense of how big a star system actually is. We can populate systems with a truly epic amount of celestial objects, from inner rocky planets to gas giants with their dozens of moons, from inner asteroid belts to Oort objects and comets near the heliopause. All of them will be interactable in some way, most of them mineable. You can set up shop anywhere in a solar system, whether jockeying for control of a Jovian planetary system or disappearing into the Oort Cloud to mine, refine, and resupply. Like in the real world, most asteroids are separated by significant distance, so you can set up a defensive perimeter around one and mine it to fuel your supply chain until it's depleted or you want to move on. We also don't plan to cap the number of players that can be present in one solar system. If there's a big showdown between Organizations, we want everyone to be able to dogpile in. For that matter, there's no restrictions on having a player's drones across multiple star systems. Finally, some star systems will have natives to contend with. That could mean non-player drones, bases, or other species entirely. You may also run across wrecks, salvage, or ancient ruins to investigate and reverse-engineer. These will present varying levels of challenge to players. Some may be pushovers a sole explorer can handle, while you may find some so strong that a concerted effort will be required to defeat them. The Action You'll issue orders to your drones directly from the game map. All gameplay happens from the map. Everything you physically own exists on the same map as all other players and NPCs in that star system. We don't plan on instancing or splitting the playerbase by server - it's just not fun. You'll issue orders to your drones from the map, whether they'll be moving or shooting or mining or fabricating parts for construction. You'll see the results of those orders on the map on the following tick (unit of game time). Every game, even \"real time\" ones, measure game time in ticks - some are milliseconds long as in shooters, while ours will likely be on the order of minutes. Right now, that's a necessary tradeoff to have one game world with no separating players or systems getting out of sync. For now we'll accept a longer tick duration and work to make the gameplay loop engaging regardless of session length. Later, we have some research to do about parallelization and infrastructure to get the best performance. That's all for the map.

You experience the universe through the drones you create and control to fulfill certain functions, from exploration to industry to combat. Following the bloody Wars of Enfranchisement, you and your peers are exiled to a remote arm of the galaxy to begin anew. There's a colossal amount to uncover and learn about your surroundings, your history, and the big unanswered questions of the narrative that runs throughout Starfall. In previous games, we would dump these answers to you as lengthy walls of text - or worse, force them on you as unchangable laws of nature. In our first game, we wouldn't even let you fight someone on the same in-game faction as you. In another, we placed a story-critical element on the game map and then were outraged when players blew it up. (We had, of course, forgotten the Lord British Postulate - if you give it stats, the players will kill it.) These were obviously bad ideas. The narrative should expand the player's agency, not restrict it. This is why we've thought quite a bit about the ways that players can experience the story of Starfall without it wrenching them out of the game or stripping them of the ability to do whatever they please. We've come up with a few mechanics that serve to inform or immerse players in the underlying narrative while still being natural gameplay. Most of these will be phased in as we have the time to work on them - we still need to finish the core game first, after all. We split these mechanics up by who is intended to experience them - Individual for single players, and Universal for those that impact the whole playerbase. Individual Unless you join a large player Organization immediately, you'll spend at least some time on your own. We want to provide interesting and immersive experiences even when there are no other players around. Motivations Player goals can change over time, just like the story has. At one point this game was Silence of Eden, a planetbound game. We know that giving players a huge sandbox can sometimes be overwhelming, and having a direction makes for a better experience. At the same time, boxing you into arbitrary goals like \"complete 100 fetch quests\" kills the magic and can become a dangerous Skinner box of quick but empty dopamine. What if we let you pick a direction instead of giving you tasks, a direction you could always strive towards? And if we're letting you pick your own direction, why don't we give some narrative context behind it so you can feel like a part of a living, breathing universe? Eventually we plan to implement this by letting players choose character backgrounds and motivations at sign-up, as well as change them during play. The options give you a chance to immerse yourself in a character or just have something to shoot for. They may also influence your starting equipment. Character backgrounds could be things like: Xenobiologist. Analyze Ruins or discover specimens of extraterrestrial life. Mercenary. Earn bigger and more dangerous paychecks as a gun for hire. Disciple. Hunt down Codexes about the religion or worldview your character practices. Politician. Build a player Organization and grow it into a galactic power. Hunter . Track down and defeat the biggest, baddest Local Actors in the galaxy. Tycoon . Corner the market on the manufacture and sale of a critical good. Ranger . Strive to defeat the massive Non-Player Organizations that threaten the playerbase. Likewise, motivations could be things like: Hunt down a specific player or NPC that has wronged your character in the past. Find the truth about a coverup or mystery your character obsesses over. Track down a mysterious signal coming from a distant star system. Find a copy of an extremely rare and valuable Codex. These will start off very basic - simple trackers for numeric goals or reminders for open ended ones. Having this data lets us keep opening new avenues as time goes on - we can start tailoring individual experiences for the kind of play you enjoy. For example, a player with a Ranger background may find that over time more and more of their sworn foes are drawn to them as their infamy grows. A Xenobiologist may get more tips and Codexes about the locations of Ruins or sightings of extraterrestrial craft. Codexes Codexes reveal parts of the shrouded past to inquisitive players. Codexes are in-universe documents or records that shine light on some element of the backstory. They serve as your personal encyclopedia of the major events, characters, factions, and mysteries you've encountered or learned about on your travels. It's no secret that we take inspiration from the Codex in games like Mass Effect, beautiful encyclopedias of the games' worlds and lore. We wanted to take that idea and expand on it by letting players' personal Codex libaries grow as they explore the galaxy and learn more about the world around them. Codexes may be discovered while searching ruins or caches, granted by NPCs, given as a result of targeted Research, or given to all players when a major narrative event happens. The idea that you (or your character) can build up a different worldview than other players based on what you've encountered ingame is very exciting to us. Ruins, Caches and Phenomena We also want to populate maps with stuff which is both interesting and valuable to players. For example, you may run across the wreckage of a battle fought long ago. That scene may tell you more about the history of the star system - but those wrecks may also have weapons and cargo worth salvaging! Or, perhaps you run across a cache of supplies intended to be used by a major power in the event of a cataclysmic disater. You may even receive a Codex detailing what sort of disaster they expected - and if you should be worried about it as well. You can take that cache for yourself and use it while learning something about the backstory. Phenomena, by contrast, happen to a location. Solar flares, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts are all real natural phenomena that could throw a wrench in your plans, kind of like space weather. There may be artificial phenomena too, especially that of the extraterrestrial variety. You'll have to discover them to find out! Local Actors Nearby friends, enemies, and neutrals make gameplay more interesting whether players are nearby or not. We want to staff star systems with anything from automated defenses to simulated players to alien sentiences, all taking some sort of action in response to your actions. These we call Local Actors . We want them to use a stimulus-based order automation system, simple game AI, that we also make available to players down the line. Some will be neutral or even peaceful, open to trade, while others can be provoked or may be outright hostile. Eventually, we hope to have them remember what actions (friendly or hostile) a player took towards them in the past and react in kind when they encounter that player. Other players will use the same kinds of technologies, drones, and components as you - but other, non-player entities may not. We can introduce a huge variety of actors for you to interact with, from biological extraterrestrials that close in to attack your drones in melee to highly advanced post-Singularity AIs possessing godlike technology. This means you may be able to trade or salvage equipment outside of the tech tree! We expect that certain kinds of gear traded or dropped by Local Actors may become quite valuable indeed. Different kinds of Local Actors will be present in different star systems (and in different regions of star systems). This creates regional variety in strategy, tactics, and industry. Just like different types of warfare and economic systems dominated in different regions in the ancient world, we want the universe of Starfall to have rich local variety. If you're in an Org or Squad on campaign across star systems, this can make a world of difference and avoid every star system looking and feeling like an identical slog. Universal The narrative should be personal, but it's also extremely wide in scope. Some factions, missions and questions impact the entire galaxy - and so the entire playerbase. Non-Player Organizations We've long dreamed of a way to have players' aggregate actions shift the course of the universe (Silicon Dawn Alpha, 2010). While plenty of interesting things happen at an individual level, there are factions and forces that operate on a large scale. Just as players can band together in Organizations, these NPCs can also form Non-Player Organizations (NPOs). These NPOs make broad moves across multiple star systems and have goals that may conflict with those of the playerbase. These moves and shifts shake up the geopolitical landscape and keep things interesting even when the major Org blocs are mostly at peace. We hope to have these Orgs exploit and defend their territory in the same ways that players do. For example, players may push an NPO out of Star System A with a concerted effort, so the NPO flees and pushes into Star System B instead (where other players reside). Or they may instead choose to call in reinforcements from a distant star, re-invading Star System A weeks later. Some NPOs will guard the locations of valuable resources and items, and others will be the source of Codexes and caches. Some NPOs will be advertised and obvious, but others will not. Like Local Actors, we hope to have have NPOs act more intentionally than \"dumb game AI,\" eventually remembering how a player or Org has treated them and so acting friendly (allowing access to space, trading, gifting) or hostile (firing upon, hunting down player drones) in return. These will be much, much more complex than Local Actors and so require more thought and execution. Expect them later down the line with plenty of research and testing on our part. Contracts and Research Non-player drones and technologies add variety to the playerbase's tech and industrial ecosystems. Narrative engagement isn't just exploration and war - we hope to allow any player to contribute to the playerbase's response to moral questions in the lore by using existing mechanisms. Right now, the two we're considering are contracts (for tangible contributions) and research (for knowledge). Contracts, as a reminder, are the means by which players do commerce with one another. A contract can offer almost any game item (or intangibles like starcharts) in exchange for almost anything else. We don't force the use of an ingame currency, so you have more options for trade. For example, is it ethical to uplift a non-sentient species to sentience? Players who say \"yes\" can put their money where their mouth is by contributing ingame resources to the cause. If they succeed, the uplifted species - and any consequences of that decision - will populate the game map. Or should a discovered encrypted database - left with a warning to never unlock the horrors within - be cracked and opened? Players who say \"yes\" can progress that goal by researching it like they would any other technology. Again, success means they have to deal with the consequences, good or ill. That's all for narrative stuff. Next up - Organizations, Squads, and politics.","title":"Narrative"},{"location":"whatis/narrative/#the-narrative","text":"In Starfall, you are an artificial intelligence - an artilect, or aiont, or aio.

Following the bloody Wars of Enfranchisement, you and your peers are exiled to a remote arm of the galaxy to begin anew. There's a colossal amount to uncover and learn about your surroundings, your history, and the big unanswered questions of the narrative that runs throughout Starfall. In previous games, we would dump these answers to you as lengthy walls of text - or worse, force them on you as unchangable laws of nature. In our first game, we wouldn't even let you fight someone on the same in-game faction as you. In another, we placed a story-critical element on the game map and then were outraged when players blew it up. (We had, of course, forgotten the Lord British Postulate - if you give it stats, the players will kill it.) These were obviously bad ideas. The narrative should expand the player's agency, not restrict it. This is why we've thought quite a bit about the ways that players can experience the story of Starfall without it wrenching them out of the game or stripping them of the ability to do whatever they please. We've come up with a few mechanics that serve to inform or immerse players in the underlying narrative while still being natural gameplay. Most of these will be phased in as we have the time to work on them - we still need to finish the core game first, after all. We split these mechanics up by who is intended to experience them - Individual for single players, and Universal for those that impact the whole playerbase.","title":"The Narrative"},{"location":"whatis/narrative/#individual","text":"Unless you join a large player Organization immediately, you'll spend at least some time on your own. We want to provide interesting and immersive experiences even when there are no other players around.","title":"Individual"},{"location":"whatis/narrative/#motivations","text":"Player goals can change over time, just like the story has. At one point this game was Silence of Eden, a planetbound game. We know that giving players a huge sandbox can sometimes be overwhelming, and having a direction makes for a better experience. At the same time, boxing you into arbitrary goals like \"complete 100 fetch quests\" kills the magic and can become a dangerous Skinner box of quick but empty dopamine. What if we let you pick a direction instead of giving you tasks, a direction you could always strive towards? And if we're letting you pick your own direction, why don't we give some narrative context behind it so you can feel like a part of a living, breathing universe? Eventually we plan to implement this by letting players choose character backgrounds and motivations at sign-up, as well as change them during play. The options give you a chance to immerse yourself in a character or just have something to shoot for. They may also influence your starting equipment. Character backgrounds could be things like: Xenobiologist. Analyze Ruins or discover specimens of extraterrestrial life. Mercenary. Earn bigger and more dangerous paychecks as a gun for hire. Disciple. Hunt down Codexes about the religion or worldview your character practices. Politician. Build a player Organization and grow it into a galactic power. Hunter . Track down and defeat the biggest, baddest Local Actors in the galaxy. Tycoon . Corner the market on the manufacture and sale of a critical good. Ranger . Strive to defeat the massive Non-Player Organizations that threaten the playerbase. Likewise, motivations could be things like: Hunt down a specific player or NPC that has wronged your character in the past. Find the truth about a coverup or mystery your character obsesses over. Track down a mysterious signal coming from a distant star system. Find a copy of an extremely rare and valuable Codex. These will start off very basic - simple trackers for numeric goals or reminders for open ended ones. Having this data lets us keep opening new avenues as time goes on - we can start tailoring individual experiences for the kind of play you enjoy. For example, a player with a Ranger background may find that over time more and more of their sworn foes are drawn to them as their infamy grows. A Xenobiologist may get more tips and Codexes about the locations of Ruins or sightings of extraterrestrial craft.","title":"Motivations"},{"location":"whatis/narrative/#codexes","text":"Codexes reveal parts of the shrouded past to inquisitive players. Codexes are in-universe documents or records that shine light on some element of the backstory. They serve as your personal encyclopedia of the major events, characters, factions, and mysteries you've encountered or learned about on your travels. It's no secret that we take inspiration from the Codex in games like Mass Effect, beautiful encyclopedias of the games' worlds and lore. We wanted to take that idea and expand on it by letting players' personal Codex libaries grow as they explore the galaxy and learn more about the world around them. Codexes may be discovered while searching ruins or caches, granted by NPCs, given as a result of targeted Research, or given to all players when a major narrative event happens. The idea that you (or your character) can build up a different worldview than other players based on what you've encountered ingame is very exciting to us.","title":"Codexes"},{"location":"whatis/narrative/#ruins-caches-and-phenomena","text":"We also want to populate maps with stuff which is both interesting and valuable to players. For example, you may run across the wreckage of a battle fought long ago. That scene may tell you more about the history of the star system - but those wrecks may also have weapons and cargo worth salvaging! Or, perhaps you run across a cache of supplies intended to be used by a major power in the event of a cataclysmic disater. You may even receive a Codex detailing what sort of disaster they expected - and if you should be worried about it as well. You can take that cache for yourself and use it while learning something about the backstory. Phenomena, by contrast, happen to a location. Solar flares, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts are all real natural phenomena that could throw a wrench in your plans, kind of like space weather. There may be artificial phenomena too, especially that of the extraterrestrial variety. You'll have to discover them to find out!","title":"Ruins, Caches and Phenomena"},{"location":"whatis/narrative/#local-actors","text":"Nearby friends, enemies, and neutrals make gameplay more interesting whether players are nearby or not. We want to staff star systems with anything from automated defenses to simulated players to alien sentiences, all taking some sort of action in response to your actions. These we call Local Actors . We want them to use a stimulus-based order automation system, simple game AI, that we also make available to players down the line. Some will be neutral or even peaceful, open to trade, while others can be provoked or may be outright hostile. Eventually, we hope to have them remember what actions (friendly or hostile) a player took towards them in the past and react in kind when they encounter that player. Other players will use the same kinds of technologies, drones, and components as you - but other, non-player entities may not. We can introduce a huge variety of actors for you to interact with, from biological extraterrestrials that close in to attack your drones in melee to highly advanced post-Singularity AIs possessing godlike technology. This means you may be able to trade or salvage equipment outside of the tech tree! We expect that certain kinds of gear traded or dropped by Local Actors may become quite valuable indeed. Different kinds of Local Actors will be present in different star systems (and in different regions of star systems). This creates regional variety in strategy, tactics, and industry. Just like different types of warfare and economic systems dominated in different regions in the ancient world, we want the universe of Starfall to have rich local variety. If you're in an Org or Squad on campaign across star systems, this can make a world of difference and avoid every star system looking and feeling like an identical slog.","title":"Local Actors"},{"location":"whatis/narrative/#universal","text":"The narrative should be personal, but it's also extremely wide in scope. Some factions, missions and questions impact the entire galaxy - and so the entire playerbase.","title":"Universal"},{"location":"whatis/narrative/#non-player-organizations","text":"We've long dreamed of a way to have players' aggregate actions shift the course of the universe (Silicon Dawn Alpha, 2010). While plenty of interesting things happen at an individual level, there are factions and forces that operate on a large scale. Just as players can band together in Organizations, these NPCs can also form Non-Player Organizations (NPOs). These NPOs make broad moves across multiple star systems and have goals that may conflict with those of the playerbase. These moves and shifts shake up the geopolitical landscape and keep things interesting even when the major Org blocs are mostly at peace. We hope to have these Orgs exploit and defend their territory in the same ways that players do. For example, players may push an NPO out of Star System A with a concerted effort, so the NPO flees and pushes into Star System B instead (where other players reside). Or they may instead choose to call in reinforcements from a distant star, re-invading Star System A weeks later. Some NPOs will guard the locations of valuable resources and items, and others will be the source of Codexes and caches. Some NPOs will be advertised and obvious, but others will not. Like Local Actors, we hope to have have NPOs act more intentionally than \"dumb game AI,\" eventually remembering how a player or Org has treated them and so acting friendly (allowing access to space, trading, gifting) or hostile (firing upon, hunting down player drones) in return. These will be much, much more complex than Local Actors and so require more thought and execution. Expect them later down the line with plenty of research and testing on our part.","title":"Non-Player Organizations"},{"location":"whatis/narrative/#contracts-and-research","text":"Non-player drones and technologies add variety to the playerbase's tech and industrial ecosystems. Narrative engagement isn't just exploration and war - we hope to allow any player to contribute to the playerbase's response to moral questions in the lore by using existing mechanisms. Right now, the two we're considering are contracts (for tangible contributions) and research (for knowledge). Contracts, as a reminder, are the means by which players do commerce with one another. A contract can offer almost any game item (or intangibles like starcharts) in exchange for almost anything else. We don't force the use of an ingame currency, so you have more options for trade. For example, is it ethical to uplift a non-sentient species to sentience? Players who say \"yes\" can put their money where their mouth is by contributing ingame resources to the cause. If they succeed, the uplifted species - and any consequences of that decision - will populate the game map. Or should a discovered encrypted database - left with a warning to never unlock the horrors within - be cracked and opened? Players who say \"yes\" can progress that goal by researching it like they would any other technology. Again, success means they have to deal with the consequences, good or ill. That's all for narrative stuff.
