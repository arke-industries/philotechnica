Starfall Starfall is an upcoming sci-fi MMO4X - a game you play with everyone else online, in the browser, to expand, explore, exploit, and exterminate in the vein of the 4X greats. We're inspired by Civilization, Stellaris, Masters of Orion, Galactic Civilizations, EVE Online - and that all-time unsung hero, Space Empires IV. We're also a bit obsessed with hard (realistic) sci-fi. We may be a little too in love with Atomic Rockets and Orion's Arm, which teach us how realistic science fiction can be exciting, thought-provoking, and ultimately satisfying. Us We are Arke Industries . We make games people love, or at least tolerate, while killing time at school or at work. We started very young, inspired by school computer lab favorites such as Cyber Nations and NationStates. We started with The Fall (2009), followed up with Silicon Dawn (2010), and since then have made a host of smaller projects while we mourn the inevitability of death. Anyways, now we're working on a new game and Starfall is it. Bye for now.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"#home","text":"","title":"Home"},{"location":"#philotechnica-a-starfall-companion","text":"We're working on this game, and sometimes we need to tell you things about it.","title":"Philotechnica, a Starfall companion"},{"location":"#starfall","text":"Starfall is an upcoming sci-fi MMO4X - a game you play with everyone else online, in the browser, to expand, explore, exploit, and exterminate in the vein of the 4X greats.

The Narrative. it's not dust and echoes(tm), every system is packed with the good, the bad, and the ugly from the minute the first player jumps in. Bullshit check! Everybody knows that procgen makes an identical ocean of crap, but without it content creation is glacial. How are you going to get enough content? Thats true! We're working on ways to mitigate that. We may need to lean on a dash of procgen to keep opening up fully fleshed systems as there's need but you never go full procgen. hi Expand Exhaustable map objects - thousands of them to drive expansion and prevent gigaturtling. You can't just sit on a resource deposit forever, it'll run out eventually. Even gas giants, over many many many years! Politics and Smallgangs(tm) - you can be a loner, but friends let you hold a larger area against massive orgs. A variety of ingame org tools let you keep your line members in the core gameplay loop without spreadsheeting your org structure and responsibilities. hi Exploit Industry - fully in-universe supply chain from start to finish - that shell you shot was mined from an asteroid, refined into metals, stamped into ammunition, and loaded into your ship by real factories all in the game world. Supply chains of varying levels make industry deep enough to be a rewarding full time gig for spreadsheeters while not becoming frustrating for other player types. Tech - tradeable, stealable, giftable techs both incremental and revolutionary. When your AI isn't issuing commands, it's researching, meaning AFK time isn't wasted Blueprints - like most space 4Xes, you'll eventually be able to design and build your own drones from hundreds of components Designs - but UNlike most space 4Xes, we'll also give you the ability to create your own components! Want to optimize a railgun to be gigantic at the cost of all else? Or create your own brand of ship components you get credit and profit from as they corner the market? You'll be able to do it - just not at release. Bullshit check! Custom designs and blueprints - how do I know this isn't marketing garbage? Easy! The code already works this way, we just haven't enabled it. There's a ton of balance work that has to go into allowing these things fairly, so the more you help out the faster it'll arrive. hi Exterminate War - good old shells, lasers, and missiles with a variety of defenses to balance them makes pursuing a pvp meta rewarding and enables varied fleet compositions for huge fights. All drones persist on the same map 24/7 so you can come to your ally's aid or ambush prey with equal ease. Market - business is just a different kind of war. Create and execute contracts to buy, sell, and share tech, resources, starmaps, and drones. More Politics - orgs obviously gonna go to war all the time. Multiple org memberships for players mean Really Fun(tm) political stuff like false flagging, ROE, and collateral damage become possible. hi It's free Yeah I know, F2P is garbage. But we're not really in it for the money. We've got jobs and incomes already, and a passion to make the game of our dreams. We've planned to ensure costs stay low and can come out of our pockets to a certain point. We have some thoughts on ethical monetization to pay for eventual server costs which we'll share soon (because quitting our jobs to make Starfall would be great eventually), but we're not asking for your money. We're just asking you to come and play. It's in the browser What is this, 2007? What are you, Jennifer Government: NationStates ? Wha- alright, we're starting in the browser because it's ridiculously extensible - you can play on desktop or on your phone, we can wrap it as a mobile app, Windows app, Steam game, console game, expose APIs for savvy players - shit, we could probably make it work on your smartwatch. We got our start in browser strategy games and .NET Core and HTML5 let you do some crazy shit nowadays. We even had a browser 3D client test. We can expand into many many directions, the point is that we nail the architecture first so we can deliver cool stuff for years without being solar plexus'd by legacy code.","title":"What is Starfall?"},{"location":"whatis/#what-is-starfall","text":"asdf","title":"What is Starfall?"},{"location":"whatis/#explore","text":"The Map. procedural generation is for pussies, but you still need a lot of map to explore so you'll get it.
