# The Narrative

## Individual

### Motivations

We know that giving players a huge sandbox can sometimes be overwhelming and having a direction makes for a better experience. At the same time, boxing you into "complete 100 fetch quests" just kills the magic, so why not let you pick your own goals from some options? And if we're letting you pick your own goals, why don't we give some narrative context behind that goal so you can feel like a part of a living, breathing universe?

Eventually we plan to let players pick goals on joining, or change them during play. The options give you a chance to immerse yourself in a character or just have something to shoot for. They may start as simple trackers for numeric goals or reminders for open ended ones, but having this data lets us start tailoring individual experiences to the kind of play you enjoy.

### Codexes

In-universe documents or records that shine light on the backstop. Mostly found via exploration. 

### Ruins, Caches and Phenomena
Stuff on the map can reveal parts of the backstory while being valuable ingame. May grant you codexes.

### Local Actors

Anything from automated defenses to simulated players to alien sentiences that will take some sort of action in response to your actions. We want them to use a stimulus-based order automation system, simple game AI, that we also make available to players down the line.

## Universal

### Non-Player Organizations

Large scale actors that move in response to the playerbase's actions on the scale of a star system or larger. We hope to have these Orgs exploit and defend their territory in the same ways that players do. Some will be advertised and obvious, but some will not. These will be much more complex than Local Actors and require more thought so expect them later down the line.

### Contracts and Research

Narrative engagement isn't just exploration and war - we hope to allow any player to contribute to the playerbase's response to moral questions in the lore by using existing mechanisms. First among them are contracts (for tangible contributions) and research (for knowledge).

For example, is it ethical to uplift a non-sentient species to sentience? Players who say "yes" can put their money where their mouth is by contributing ingame resources to the cause. If they succeed, the uplifted species - and any consequences of that decision - will populate the game map.

That's all for narrative stuff. Next up - Organizations, Squads, and politics.
