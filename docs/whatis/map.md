# The Map and Exploration

## The Map. 
Everything happens on the map. The galaxy has many star systems, and each star system is its own sprawling map filled with things to interact with. Heavenly bodies like stars, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets all exist on the map and can be interacted with, from mining asteroids to solar power from stars. Artificial objects exist too - other players' assets, obviously, but also non-player ships and bases, wrecks and salvage, and ancient ruins to investigate and reverse-engineer. We expect to see thousands of objects in star systems, and since all of them can be depleted, stolen, or blown up, each star system will change dramatically over time as players live in them. We're not fans of procedural generation and its endless piles of same-y stuff so we're working on ways to provide truly massive amounts of interesting, unique content.

## Discovery. 
We don't provide maps of all the stars out there - you have to go find and explore them yourselves with FTL-equipped starships. The next star system you explore could be an unhabited cornucopia of resources, or it could turn out to be a hive of the nastiest baddies imaginable. We want to reward explorers in a variety of ways, from letting them sell exclusive starmaps of their discovered systems to letting them name heavenly bodies.

1. All gameplay happens from the map. Everything you physically own exists on the same map as all other players and as all NPCs - no instancing.
2. The map is divided into star systems. Get between them with FTL.
3. Each star system has game objects.
4. We populate star systems with realistic usable objects.
5. You won't know about all star systems - you or your Org will have to explore them yourselves or buy starmaps from other players.
6. You'll be able to detect nearby stars with exosolar equipment and jump to them. Eager explorers will have first dibs at the resources of the system - if they can overcome the natives, and if nobody else has beaten them to it...
