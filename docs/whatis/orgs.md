# Players and Organization

It's been pretty busy with the holidays and the world continuing to end, but we're getting back into the swing of things. With Omega Release under our belt, we're proceeding to a major internal refactor, usability pass, and dev playtest to make the game accessible for our playtesters later on with Psi Release.

Today it's time to talk about how players organize themselves. We know from our past games that player organization is the lifeblood of the game and we want to encourage big, impressive empires of players. At the same time, we've seen firsthand that exclusively giant orgs can feel bureaucratic and lifeless and even make the game unfun. We'll try to balance these scales by delineating between Avatars, Squads, and Organizations.

## Avatars

- you, kinda
- analagous to characters
- we'll start you with one, but eventually let players acquire multiple
- can be account-bound (personal) or organization-bound (communal)
- can join squads or orgs

## Squads

- small, tight-knit units
- preferably, a group of friends
- share all permissions like allow repair, allow cargo add/remove, sensor data sharing
- can join orgs or act independently
- only for a group of avatars you trust

## Organizations

- large player organizations
- avatars can join multiple (jury's out on how to UI this well)
- can have squads, avatars, or both as members
- can create avatars bound to that org
- can designate squads to have permissions to use bound avatars. if the org is the United Federation of Planets and the squad is Starfleet, the avatar would be the Second Fleet - one controller for a bunch of drones that squad members could hop in to control as needed.
